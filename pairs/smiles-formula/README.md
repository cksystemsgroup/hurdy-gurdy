# Pair — `smiles-formula`  ·  SMILES → molecular formula

*Status: **registered** (not yet built). Ported from v2 — a compile pair and
field-blindness witness.*

Translate a SMILES string to its molecular formula (Hill notation). This is
a **compile pair**, not a reasoning pair: its target is a representation, not
a solver input, so it has no solver and no `proved` tier — only a faithful,
deterministic re-representation. It exists to show the same pair machinery
and commuting-square contract carry an entirely **non-computational**
translation unchanged.

## Components ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) §2)

- **Source.** SMILES — [`languages/smiles`](../../languages/smiles/README.md).
- **Target.** molecular formula —
  [`languages/molecular-formula`](../../languages/molecular-formula/README.md).
- **Translator `T`.** A schema-determined map: parse the SMILES molecular
  graph, apply implicit-hydrogen rules, count atoms, emit Hill notation.
  Deterministic and **schema-predictable**.
- **Source interpreter.** The **shared** SMILES interpreter (the graph
  reader) ([`languages/smiles`](../../languages/smiles/README.md)) — reused;
  contributed by this pair if first.
- **Target interpreter.** The **shared** molecular-formula reader/normalizer
  ([`languages/molecular-formula`](../../languages/molecular-formula/README.md))
  — reused.
- **Target-to-source interpreter `L`.** Maps a formula's atom multiset back
  to the source-graph observable (the multiset). There is no solver witness
  here; `L` is the trivial re-projection that lets the square be checked.
  Pair-owned.

## Projection `π`

The **atom multiset**. The pair preserves the multiset of atoms; it
**discards** connectivity (bonds, rings, stereochemistry) — an explicit,
honest loss ([`PATHS.md`](../../PATHS.md) §3).

## Fidelity target + evidence

- **`predicted`** — given the SMILES and the OpenSMILES + Hill-notation
  rules, the formula is determined byte-for-byte. A compile pair has no
  `proved` tier (no solver); its assurance is byte-prediction plus the
  square.

## Soundness story

The square commutes by construction: the atom multiset computed from the
source graph (`I_smiles`) equals the multiset of the emitted formula
(`L(I_formula(T(p)))`). Validate the SMILES reader against RDKit/InChI
([`languages/smiles`](../../languages/smiles/README.md),
[`PAIRING.md`](../../PAIRING.md) §6).

## Notes for the implementing agent

- This is the cheapest end-to-end witness that the architecture is
  field-blind — keep it small and exact.
- No solver, no certificate; the deliverable is the translator, the trivial
  `L`, and the declared `π` (atom multiset kept, connectivity discarded).
