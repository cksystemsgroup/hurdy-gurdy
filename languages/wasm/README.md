# Language — WebAssembly (Wasm)

WebAssembly 1.0 (the MVP), as a **bytecode/VM** source language. Source of
`wasm-btor2`. The initial scope is the integer-only core (no floating
point, no GC/reference types, no threads) until a pair widens it.

## Formal semantics (source of truth)

WebAssembly is unusual — and ideal for this platform — in that its **official
standard *is* a formal small-step operational semantics**. A Wasm module's
meaning is defined by the spec's reduction rules over a stack machine with
typed values, linear memory, and structured control flow. There is no
undefined behavior to reconcile the way C/ISA pairs have; the gap a Wasm
pair exploits is between a high-level intuition and the precise spec.

## Formal model — no Sail (Sail targets ISAs), but strong mechanizations

Wasm has no Sail model (Sail describes hardware ISAs), but its official
formal semantics has been **mechanized** more completely than almost any
other language:

- **WasmCert-Isabelle** and **WasmCert-Coq** — mechanized Wasm 1.0 with
  *verified executable interpreters*.
- **KWasm** — a K-framework mechanization, tested against the official
  conformance suite.

Any of these is a gold oracle for the shared Wasm interpreter below, and a
candidate second route (`wasm → wasmcert/kwasm → …`) for a fidelity-raising
branch. Recommended: track the **official spec interpreter / WasmCert** as
the reference.

## Shared interpreter

**Role: source.** A deterministic executor of the in-scope Wasm subset over
an input binding → a trace of post-step stack-machine states (value stack,
locals, linear memory, program counter / control stack), per
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) §5. Because the spec is itself
operational, the interpreter can mirror it rule-for-rule and be checked
against WasmCert / the reference interpreter. Shared by every Wasm pair.

*Status: **partial** (interp v0.6) — the integer value-stack core at **two
widths** (i32 and i64) over a single function body (straight-line *plus* the
structured conditional `if`/`else`/`end`) is built
([`gurdy/languages/wasm/`](../../gurdy/languages/wasm/), contributed by the
`wasm-btor2` slice), mirroring the official operational semantics rule-for-rule:
the operand producers `i32.const` / `i64.const` / `local.get` (a local declares
its width), the local store `local.set`, the conditional `select`, the unary
comparisons `i32.eqz` / `i64.eqz`, the full **binary-operator family at each
width** — `{i32,i64}.add`/`sub`/`mul`/`and`/`or`/`xor`, the shifts
`shl`/`shr_u`/`shr_s` (shift amount taken mod the width — mod 32 for i32, mod 64
for i64), and the comparisons `eq`/`ne`/`lt_{s,u}`/`gt_{s,u}`/`le_{s,u}`/`ge_{s,u}`
(the `_s` variants two's-complement signed; **every comparison yields an i32**
result at both widths) — the **division / remainder family**
`{i32,i64}.div_s`/`div_u`/`rem_s`/`rem_u` with the Wasm **trap** semantics (a zero
divisor — and `div_s` signed overflow `INT_MIN / −1` — traps, setting a `trapped`
observable, a *defined* halt; `rem_s` of `INT_MIN % −1` is `0`, no trap), and the
**structured conditional** `if <blocktype> <then> [else <else>] end` — executed as
one step (pop an i32 condition, run the *taken* arm), with the Wasm validation
discipline enforced (i32 condition, both arms balance to the block result, no
`else` only for a void block) or a typed `Unsupported`; a nested `if` is allowed,
while `block`/`loop`/`br`/`br_if`/`br_table` stay out of scope. The value stack
carries two widths and locals are mutable. Post-step observables are `pc / halted
/ trapped / sp / stack / locals` (stack/local values are width-masked integers;
`trapped` flags a defined div/rem trap, distinct from a normal off-the-end halt).
Every other opcode hard-aborts with a typed `Unsupported`
([`BENCHMARKS.md`](../../BENCHMARKS.md) §3). The `0.5 → 0.6` bump (AGENTS.md §3)
added the **structured `if`/`else`/`end` + `local.set`** **additively** — no
existing rule's value changed and a body with no `if`/`local.set` runs byte-for-
byte as before, so the dependent `wasm-btor2` square re-validated green (earlier
bumps: `0.4 → 0.5` the div/rem trap family, `0.3 → 0.4` the i64 value type,
`0.2 → 0.3` the i32 binop family, `0.1 → 0.2` `select` (`0x1b`) + `i32.eqz`
(`0x45`)). WasmCert / `.wast` anchoring and the rest of the core (rotates, the
i32↔i64 width conversions, the *real* control flow `block`/`loop`/`br`, linear
memory) are pending.*

## Public benchmarks

Coverage anchor ([`BENCHMARKS.md`](../../BENCHMARKS.md) §4): the **official
WebAssembly spec tests** (`.wast` conformance, expected results) as a pinned
submodule — the same suite WasmCert/KWasm use — plus **wasm-smith** for
fuzz/mutation coverage. Includes rejection (invalid-module) cases.
