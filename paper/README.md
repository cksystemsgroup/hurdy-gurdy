# POPL 2027 milestone snapshot (July 2026)

This directory is a **milestone snapshot**: a paper-shaped account of what
hurdy-gurdy can do **right now** (July 2026), written against the POPL 2027
deadline (July 9, 2026). It is committed to the repository deliberately,
whether or not it is submitted: it fixes the formal story, the measured
capability/coverage state, and the experimental evidence at this point in
the project, as the baseline a later submission (ESOP/PLDI 2027, POPL 2028)
ratchets from.

- `main.tex` + `sections/` — the paper (acmart `sigplan`, double-blind
  `review,anonymous` mode). **Note:** the live repo is public and named in
  the text's provenance; an actual double-blind submission requires an
  anonymized artifact snapshot and scrubbing the lineage references.
- `results/` — machine-generated evidence: the capability matrix, the
  branch-agreement and case-study runs, the bugs-caught table mined from
  history, timings. Regenerate with `make results` (see `results/README.md`).
- `Makefile` — `make` builds `main.pdf` via `latexmk`; `make results`
  re-runs the harness.

Snapshot claims are **as-of-now** measurements, not aspirations: coverage
numbers are the per-construct conjunction (covered ∧ faithful) recorded in
the registry at this commit; the `proved` tier is reported exactly as far
as its independent checker actually runs today.
