## 2026-05-16T00:30:00Z — P0 plan landed

- **Phase**: pre-P0 → P0 (planned, not yet implemented).
- **What changed**: `PLAN.md` rewritten as the v2 phase plan. v1
  PLAN.md is preserved on `main`. Phases P0–P16+ defined with
  per-phase Goal / Increments / Acceptance / References. RAM-safety
  and `no-main-edits` listed as cross-cutting concerns.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0.1 — update `pyproject.toml`
  for the v2 package layout (declare optional extras for solvers;
  keep `gurdy` script entry point). Inspect `main:pyproject.toml`
  first via `git show main:pyproject.toml`. Do not delete or rename
  any existing v1 files yet — v2 scaffold lives alongside until P0
  is fully green.
- **Open blockers**: none.

## 2026-05-16T00:00:00Z — Bootstrap created

- **Phase**: pre-P0 (scaffold not yet written).
- **What changed**: branch `v2-bootstrap` created from `main` at
  commit `59afce8`. `V2_BOOTSTRAP.md`, `V2_AGENT_LOOP.md`, and this
  file added. No code changes yet.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0 increment 1 — write the v2
  `PLAN.md` (phase-by-phase, in the spirit of `main`'s `PLAN.md` but
  reorganized around the three pillars per `V2_BOOTSTRAP.md` §3).
  Do not start coding until `PLAN.md` is in.
- **Open blockers**: none.
