## 2026-05-16T04:50:00Z — P3.2 CBMC adapter + first SOTA datapoint

- **Phase**: P3.2 done; P3.6 (Pono-native) is the right next pick
  before the harder Docker-only baselines (P3.4/P3.5).
- **What changed**: `bench/riscv-btor2/baselines/cbmc.py`
  implements `run_one(task_dir, *, timeout_s, memory_mb, unwind)
  -> dict` per `baselines/README.md` §3. Subprocess invocation:
  `cbmc <task.cbmc.c> --unwind 20 --bounds-check --pointer-check`
  with `subprocess.run` timeout and `setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS)`
  memory cap (macOS doesn't enforce RLIMIT_AS strictly but the
  intent is recorded).
- **Smoke results** (3-task default, `--max-tasks 3`, CBMC 6.9.0):

  | Task                          | expected   | cbmc        | correct | wall_s |
  |-------------------------------|------------|-------------|---------|--------|
  | 0100-c-add-trap-correct       | unreachable| unreachable | ✓       | 0.204  |
  | 0101-c-add-trap-bug           | reachable  | reachable   | ✓       | 0.026  |
  | 0102-c-mul-chain-correct      | unreachable| unreachable | ✓       | 0.026  |

  **3/3 correct, all subsecond.** First concrete SOTA datapoint
  for the Pareto comparison.
- The adapter handles all schema verdict cases: VERIFICATION
  FAILED → reachable, VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL → unreachable
  (with unwinding-warning → unknown), PARSING ERROR → error,
  TimeoutExpired → timeout, no `task.cbmc.c` → skip, missing
  cbmc binary → error with note.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: **P3.6 — Pono-native
  adapter**. Pono is the most apples-to-apples peer (it consumes
  the same BTOR2 hurdy-gurdy emits). On macOS, building from
  source is feasible but not autonomous-safe; the adapter
  follows CBMC's pattern of detecting binary absence and
  skip-with-note. If `pono` is on PATH, smoke-test on ≤ 3 tasks.
  Pono adapter logic: run `pono -e bmc -k <bound> <task_btor2>`,
  parse stdout for `sat`/`unsat`/`unknown`. Map to schema:
  `sat` → reachable, `unsat` → unreachable (within bound),
  `unknown` → unknown. The BTOR2 for each task isn't pre-built;
  the adapter will need to compile_spec via the hurdy-gurdy
  toolchain to produce it on the fly. Decide adapter
  granularity: compile-then-pono vs require pre-built BTOR2.
  ESBMC (P3.3) is also a viable next pick if Pono is unavailable.
- **Open blockers**: 1 escalated (P1.3a translator fix). No
  change.

---

## 2026-05-16T04:30:00Z — P3.1 corpus-input audit

- **Phase**: P3.1 done; P3.2 (CBMC adapter) next.
- **What changed**: `bench/riscv-btor2/baselines/corpus_inputs.json`
  produced from a read-only scan. 89 tasks with `task.toml`.
- **Numbers**:
  - 89 tasks total.
  - 35 tasks have `task.c` (the `0100+` C-derived series).
  - **25 tasks have `task.cbmc.c`** — pre-prepared CBMC-ready C
    source. These are the immediate Pareto-comparison candidates.
  - 54 tasks have `source.S` (hand-written assembly seed series
    `0001–0099`). Only comparable against Pono-native.
  - 0 tasks have `source.c` (my initial filter looked for the
    wrong filename — corrected in this audit). 0 have `source.bc`.
- **What this changes for the baselines plan**:
  - **P3.2 (CBMC)** is immediately feasible on 25 tasks — no
    corpus modifications needed. The Pareto table will simply
    skip asm-only tasks for CBMC/ESBMC.
  - The 54 asm-only tasks will only have Pono-native as a peer
    (P3.6). Acceptable; the comparison is still meaningful where
    both tools apply.
  - **No LLVM bitcode (`.bc`) anywhere**. SeaHorn / Symbiotic
    adapters (P3.4 / P3.5) will need to either (a) generate `.bc`
    from `task.c` at runtime, or (b) be scoped to only run after
    a one-shot per-task `.bc` materialization step. Add that as
    a sub-decision in `baselines/README.md` (next iter or in
    P3.4 itself).
- **Next iteration's planned work**: **P3.2 — CBMC adapter
  skeleton**. Write `bench/riscv-btor2/baselines/cbmc.py`
  implementing the `run_one(task_dir, *, timeout_s, memory_mb) ->
  dict` interface per `baselines/README.md` §3. Subprocess invokes
  `cbmc <task.cbmc.c> --bounds-check --pointer-check --unwind <K>`
  (or similar; consult CBMC docs at adapter-write time) with the
  RAM-safety caps from `V2_AGENT_LOOP.md` §4. If `cbmc` isn't on
  PATH, return `verdict=error notes="cbmc not found"` cleanly —
  the adapter must skip-with-note, not crash. Smoke test on
  ≤ 3 tasks. **Do not** invoke any other baseline this iter.
- **Open blockers**: 1 escalated (P1.3a translator fix). No new
  blocker.

---

## 2026-05-16T04:10:00Z — P3 prep: baselines design doc

- **Phase**: P3 prep (P1.3a BLOCKER still escalated to user, not
  blocking progress on independent tracks).
- **What changed**: `bench/riscv-btor2/baselines/README.md`
  created (pure design doc, no code). Covers:
  - The five candidate SOTA tools and what makes each a peer:
    CBMC, ESBMC, SeaHorn, Symbiotic, Pono-native.
  - Two explicit deferrals with rationale: KLEE (different
    question class), CPAchecker (heavy install).
  - Uniform output schema: one JSON line per (task, question)
    with `tool / task / verdict / wall_s / rss_mb / expected /
    correct / cmd / raw_excerpt / notes`.
  - Adapter interface: `run_one(task_dir, *, timeout_s, memory_mb)
    -> dict`.
  - macOS reality: only CBMC is reasonably native; SeaHorn /
    Symbiotic / ESBMC need Docker. Per V2_AGENT_LOOP.md §4 the
    agent **cannot** autonomously `docker pull` or install
    system packages; adapters skip-with-note when their binary
    is absent.
  - C-source availability sub-audit (P3.1): scan corpus for
    tasks with `source.c` alongside `source.elf`; tasks without
    C source compare only against Pono-native.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: **P3.1 — corpus input
  audit**. Scan `bench/riscv-btor2/corpus/` for `source.c`
  alongside `source.elf` and produce
  `bench/riscv-btor2/baselines/corpus_inputs.json` mapping each
  task id to its available input formats (`elf` always, `c` if
  present, `bc` if present). Read-only scan; no compile. Cap at
  reading file headers, not contents — tasks/89 × small read is
  RAM-safe but stream the listing rather than slurp all at once.
- **Open blockers**: **1 escalated** (P1.3a translator fix).
  Iter-count for §8 stop condition: 1 BLOCKER-iter (iter 11), 0
  follow-up BLOCKER-iters (this iter pivoted, didn't add to
  count).

---

## 2026-05-16T03:50:00Z — P1.3a SortMismatch diagnosis (escalating to user)

- **Phase**: P1.3a complete (diagnosis); fix escalated to user.
- **What changed**: Full diagnosis of the iter-10 BLOCKER. No code
  changes this iteration — the proposed fix is ≤ 25 LOC but
  modifies v1 translator emission, which is not autonomous-safe
  per `V2_AGENT_LOOP.md` §1.3a guidance ("framework fix may need
  v1-side review").
- **Root cause** (concrete):
  - Bug location: `gurdy/pairs/riscv_btor2/translation/exprs.py:218`.
  - The `parse_and_emit` dispatcher for `add/sub/and/or/xor`
    hardcodes the result sort as `"bv64"`. For arithmetic
    (`add/sub`) on register operands that's correct; for boolean
    `and/or/xor` of predicates (like the combined `bad` clause's
    AND of two `eq` results, both bv1), the emitted result sort
    is **wrong** — should be `bv1`.
  - Concrete reproduction: task 0007-simple-add-baseline emits:
    ```
    87 eq  1 39 63   # bv1 equality
    89 eq  1 17 88   # bv1 equality
    90 and 4 87 89   # MALFORMED: result_sort=bv64 with bv1 operands
    91 bad 90
    ```
  - The strict evaluator in `gurdy/pairs/riscv_btor2/btor2/
    evaluator.py:148` raises `SortMismatch("'and': operand widths
    1, 1 must match result width 64")` — exactly as designed.
  - The strict evaluator's docstring explicitly states it was
    added to catch translator bugs that "previously only surfaced
    on full-corpus dispatch."
  - Real solvers don't reject the malformed BTOR2 in
    `framework_oracle.py` because they parse with different
    leniency, but the witness they produce can't be cleanly
    replayed by the in-process simulator.
- **Proposed fix** (≤ 25 LOC, **not applied**):
  1. Add `_nid_sort: dict[int, str]` to `Builder` (3 LOC init +
     ~5 LOC populated by `const`, `ones`, `emit`).
  2. Add `Builder.sort_of_nid(nid) -> str | None` method (~3 LOC).
  3. In `exprs.py` `and/or/xor` branch (~10 LOC), look up the
     first operand's sort and emit the result with the same sort
     (operands are required to be uniform-width in BTOR2, so
     either operand's sort works as the answer).
  4. Keep `add/sub/mul` hardcoded to `"bv64"`.
- **Why escalating, not patching**:
  - Modifies v1 translator emission. Any spec that hits the
    buggy code path will produce different bytes after the fix —
    this is a real behavior change.
  - Determinism contract: v1's translator is supposed to be
    pure/deterministic. The fix is corrective (the existing
    output is malformed BTOR2), but downstream consumers may
    have golden-byte tests.
  - Solver compat: real solvers were *tolerating* the malformed
    output; we don't know if their witness format depends on
    the malformed sort. Worth verifying with `framework_oracle.py`
    after the fix.
  - Test suite: tests in `tests/pairs/riscv_btor2/translation/`
    likely include byte-level assertions that would break. Needs
    a full pytest run, not the targeted ≤ 5-task smoke we'd do
    autonomously.
- **Action needed from user**: review the proposed fix and
  approve. Once approved (`UNBLOCKED: approve P1.3a fix`), a
  subsequent iteration will:
  1. Apply the ≤ 25 LOC patch.
  2. Run `pytest tests/pairs/riscv_btor2/translation/ -q`.
  3. Run `framework_oracle.py` on the seed corpus to confirm
     verdicts unchanged.
  4. Re-run `oracle_align.py` on 0007 + 0002 to confirm
     alignment now succeeds.
- **Next iteration's planned work** (independent of BLOCKER):
  **pivot to P3 prep** — write
  `bench/riscv-btor2/baselines/README.md` sketching the
  per-tool subprocess wrapper interface (CBMC / ESBMC / SeaHorn /
  Symbiotic / Pono-native), the uniform output schema, and which
  tools to defer (require Linux-only / Docker / heavy install).
  No tool installation, no subprocess invocations yet. Pure
  design doc to be ready when the BLOCKER clears.
- **Open blockers**: **1 escalated** (P1.3a fix awaiting user
  approval). Not a regression — the BLOCKER from iter 10 now has
  a complete diagnosis and a concrete patch.

---

## 2026-05-16T03:30:00Z — P1.3 replay+align wired; latent bug exposed

- **Phase**: P1 (P1.3 wired; new BLOCKER opened).
- **What changed**: `oracle_align.py` `_run_one_question`'s
  `reachable` branch now:
  - loads source ELF via `load_riscv_binary(spec.binary.path)`,
  - calls `replay_witness(artifact, raw, source=source)` to get a
    `JoinedTrace`,
  - builds a projection from the artifact (walks the flattened
    BTOR2 once for the state-symbol → nid map; mirrors the
    private helper in `gurdy/pairs/riscv_btor2/__init__.py`),
  - walks the JoinedTrace step-by-step through the projection,
  - maps agreement → `status=PASS align_kind=ok`, first
    divergence → `status=FAIL align_kind=diverge` with
    `divergence_step` + `divergence_label`.
  - All replay/align exceptions → `status=ERROR` with the
    underlying exception type + message.
- **The §4 alignment-oracle contract is now operationally wired
  end-to-end** — when it can run.
- **BLOCKER: framework BTOR2 simulator hits a SortMismatch on
  every reachable-witness replay**. Smoke run on two known-
  reachable tasks (`0002-bound-sensitive-loop` and
  `0007-simple-add-baseline`) both returned
  `ERROR (replay/align: SortMismatch: 'and': operand widths 1, 1
  must match result width 64)`. The error is inside the
  `replay_witness` call path (`gurdy/pairs/riscv_btor2/
  reasoning_interp/interpreter.py` or
  `gurdy/pairs/riscv_btor2/lift/replayer.py`'s internal call to
  the simulator), not in my new oracle code. This is exactly the
  kind of latent framework bug the alignment oracle exists to
  surface — but it now blocks measuring alignment on any
  reachable task.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: **P1.3a — diagnose the
  SortMismatch**. Read the simulator code path for the
  width-checking logic; identify whether the bug is in (a) the
  parser interpreting a translator-emitted clause's result sort,
  (b) the simulator's `and` op implementation, or (c) the
  translator emitting a width-incoherent clause. Single-step:
  run a single small reachable task with a print statement at
  the failing op site to learn which clause/nid triggers. If the
  root cause needs a fix beyond ≤ 30 LOC, file a separate
  BLOCKER and stop the loop pending user review (the framework
  fix may need v1-side review and is not autonomous-safe).
- **Open blockers**: 1 (the SortMismatch above). Counter for §8
  stop-condition: 1 BLOCKER, no user response expected this iter.

---

## 2026-05-16T03:10:00Z — P1.2 compile+dispatch wiring

- **Phase**: P1 (P1.2 done; P1.3 next).
- **What changed**: `oracle_align.py` `run_one` stub replaced with
  the real compile→dispatch→verdict-classification pipeline.
  - Imports `compile_spec`, `dispatch` from `gurdy.core.tools`.
  - Loader mirrors `framework_oracle.py:_load_spec_obj` (rewrites
    `binary.path` to absolute so dispatch resolves the ELF
    regardless of cwd).
  - Multi-question support via `_iter_questions` (mirrors
    `framework_oracle.iter_questions`); each question is reported
    as `task::qN`.
  - Verdict mapping at this iter:
    - `reachable` → `SKIP` with note "P1.3 pending: align this
      witness" (witness exists; alignment logic is next iter).
    - `unreachable` / `proved` / `unknown` → `SKIP` (alignment
      doesn't apply without a concrete trajectory).
    - other / exception → `ERROR`.
  - `AlignResult` gained `raw_verdict`, `engine`, `elapsed`.
- **Smoke verified**:
  - `--task 0001-x0-write-dropped` (`expected=unreachable`):
    `SKIP align=N/A (verdict=unreachable)` — dispatch ran, raw
    verdict captured, classification correct.
  - `--task 0002-bound-sensitive-loop` (`expected=reachable`):
    `SKIP align=N/A (P1.3 pending: align this witness)` — witness
    produced; P1.3 will replay+align here.
- Both runs completed within the RAM-safety budget (single solver
  subprocess each).
- **Next iteration's planned work**: **P1.3** — wire
  `replay_witness` + `align_traces` for the `reachable` branch.
  Per task with `reachable` verdict: load the source ELF (via
  `gurdy.pairs.riscv_btor2.source.loader.load_riscv_binary`), call
  `replay_witness(spec, artifact, raw_result)` to get a
  `JoinedTrace`, then call `align_traces(source_trace,
  reasoning_trace, make_projection(...))` and map the
  `CrossCheckReport` outcome to `align_kind='ok'` (status=PASS) or
  `align_kind='diverge'` (status=FAIL) with divergence step+label.
  Smoke test on `--task 0002-bound-sensitive-loop` — expect PASS
  (translator is sound; alignment should hold).
- **Open blockers**: none.

---

## 2026-05-16T02:50:00Z — P1.1 oracle_align.py shell

- **Phase**: P1 (P1.1 done; P1.2 next).
- **What changed**: First code-write iteration on v2-bootstrap.
  `bench/riscv-btor2/oracle_align.py` shell added: argparse with
  `--task / --max-steps / --engine / --corpus / --max-tasks / --json`,
  task discovery mirroring `oracle.py` and `framework_oracle.py`,
  per-task `AlignResult` dataclass + `render_row`, stubbed
  `run_one()` returning `SKIP` with note "stub: P1.2 not yet
  implemented". Imports verified (framework loads cleanly via
  `import gurdy.pairs.riscv_btor2`). `--help` works. Running on the
  corpus discovers 89 tasks (capped at 5 by --max-tasks for RAM
  safety) and prints SKIP rows correctly.
- **Side observation**: the corpus already has **89 tasks**, well
  above the v2 PLAN P2 target of ≥ 50. P2 (SV-COMP scale-up) may
  be already-done or much smaller scope than written. Worth
  reading bench/riscv-btor2/CORPUS_V0.5_PLAN.md against actual
  corpus contents next time P2 surfaces.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P1.2 — replace the `run_one`
  stub with the compile→dispatch→verdict-classification pipeline.
  Per task: load spec/binary, call compile + dispatch (engine from
  `analysis` directive or `--engine` flag), classify verdict.
  Branch: on `reachable` → mark for P1.3 (replay+align); on
  `unreachable/proved/unknown` → `SKIP(N/A)`. Still no alignment
  logic; only verdict capture. RAM-safe: ≤ 3 tasks per smoke run.
- **Open blockers**: none.

---

## 2026-05-16T02:30:00Z — P0.5b PLAN.md correction

- **Phase**: P0 complete (audit + correction); next is P1.
- **What changed**: PLAN.md rewritten to reflect the P0 audit
  findings. The new plan has just four real phases:
  - **P0** ✅ — audit (iters 2–6, done).
  - **P1** — primary alignment oracle (`oracle_align.py`, the §4
    contract operationalised). The **only** "build" phase, because
    every other §3 pillar contract is already satisfied by v1.
  - **P2** — SV-COMP slice scale-up from 10 → ≥ 50 tasks (the
    in-progress corpus v0.5 work).
  - **P3** — SOTA baselines (CBMC, ESBMC, SeaHorn, Symbiotic,
    Pono-native) for the Pareto comparison.
  - **P4+** — iteration to dominance (steady state).
  - An appendix lists "was P1–P15" as already-shipped to prevent
    future re-planning.
- The original PLAN.md framed v1–v13 as "to build"; the audit
  showed they were "already shipped". The single real gap is the
  bench-side primary alignment oracle (≤ 150 LOC). Other v2 work
  is empirical (corpus + SOTA + iteration), not foundational.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: **P1.1** — sketch
  `bench/riscv-btor2/oracle_align.py` shell matching the shape of
  `oracle.py` and `framework_oracle.py`: argparse, task discovery,
  per-task loop, PASS/SKIP/FAIL output. **No alignment logic yet**
  (that's P1.2–P1.3). This is the first iteration with a code
  edit that will exercise v1's import-correctness — run `python -m
  pytest tests/ -q` after the shell lands as a tiny smoke check.
- **Open blockers**: none. P0 closes here.

---

## 2026-05-16T02:10:00Z — P0.4 schema audit: PLAN.md was misframed

- **Phase**: P0 (P0.4 done; P0.5 next).
- **What changed**: `V2_AUDIT.md` extended with §"P0.4 — schema
  audit". Two material findings:
  1. SCHEMA.md is at v1.1.0, but v1.1.0 is **byte-compatible** with
     v1.0.0 for specs that opt out of §14 vocabulary (line 443–446
     in SCHEMA.md pins this with a regression test). The PLAN.md
     framing of "v1.0.0 minimal viable downgrade" was wrong — v2's
     starting schema is just v1.1.0, with §14 features opt-in.
  2. The v1 schema baseline ISA is **RV64I+M+C** (per §12 line 341),
     not RV64I. PLAN.md P9 (add M) and P10 (add C) describe work
     that is already done. Same for P11 (multi-callee scope) —
     already in §6 Dispatch.
- Filed as **P0.5b — PLAN.md correction**: revise P1/P9/P10/P11.
  P0.5a (bench-side primary alignment oracle) is unchanged.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0.5b — apply the PLAN.md
  corrections (≤ 20 LOC). Specifically: rewrite P1 to "accept
  v1.1.0 schema as v2's starting schema, no downgrade"; delete P9,
  P10, P11 as phases (note in PLAN.md that they were retrospective);
  renumber if it improves clarity; cross-link the V2_AUDIT.md P0.4
  finding.
- **Open blockers**: none. This is the third plan-side correction
  in P0 (iter 3 was alongside-v1; this is schema-baseline). Pattern:
  the plan was written before reading the repo carefully. Worth
  noting if a future iteration is tempted to plan-by-assumption
  again.

---

## 2026-05-16T01:50:00Z — P0.3 pair audit landed

- **Phase**: P0 (P0.3 done; P0.4 next).
- **What changed**: `V2_AUDIT.md` extended with §"P0.3 — pair audit".
  All three §3 pillars (source_interp, reasoning_interp,
  translation) conform. All five solver adapters present (z3-bmc,
  z3-spacer, bitwuzla, cvc5, pono). The §4 alignment-oracle
  machinery exists in `gurdy/core/interp/align.py` +
  `gurdy/pairs/riscv_btor2/lift/replayer.py` (builds `JoinedTrace`
  from witness, framework walks via `align_traces`). **One
  operational gap**: this machinery is invoked per-witness via the
  `replay` tool, not as a bench-side per-task primary oracle. The
  bench-side files are `oracle.py` (concrete-execution,
  solver-free, §9.10), `framework_oracle.py` (compile→dispatch→
  lift verdict comparison, §B0), and `oracle_cross.py` (engine
  agreement, §4.5) — none of them runs `align_traces` per task.
  Filed as **P0.5a — `bench/riscv-btor2/oracle_align.py`** (≤ 150
  LOC).
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0.4 — schema audit. Read
  `gurdy/pairs/riscv_btor2/SCHEMA.md`, identify what's at v1.1.0
  scope that exceeds the v2-target v1.0.0 scope (BranchPin,
  CycleInvariant.dual_role, volatile layer, M extension, C
  extension, multi-callee scope). Append §"P0.4 — schema audit"
  to V2_AUDIT.md.
- **Open blockers**: none.

---

## 2026-05-16T01:30:00Z — P0.2 v1-core audit landed

- **Phase**: P0 (P0.2 done; P0.3–P0.5 queued).
- **What changed**: `V2_AUDIT.md` created. Maps every
  `V2_BOOTSTRAP.md` §3 contract (three pillars, alignment oracle,
  spec, schema discipline, pair protocol, determinism) to v1 status.
  Headline: v1 **broadly conforms**. Two documentation-class gaps
  (P0.2a: assert load-bearing-from-day-one in
  `core/interp/README.md`; P0.2b: verify bench-harness uses
  `align_traces` as primary oracle, deferred to P0.3). Three
  follow-up audits queued: P0.3 (pair), P0.4 (schema), P0.5 (gap
  numbering). No code touched.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0.3 — `gurdy/pairs/
  riscv_btor2/` audit. Read source_interp, reasoning_interp,
  translation, solvers, lift surfaces; append §"riscv-btor2 pair"
  to `V2_AUDIT.md`. Also resolve P0.2b: search `bench/riscv-btor2/`
  for the primary-oracle wiring.
- **Open blockers**: none.

---

## 2026-05-16T01:10:00Z — P0 reframed: alongside-v1 audit, not wipe

- **Phase**: P0 (revised).
- **What changed**: I noticed (when an attempted `git rm -r gurdy/`
  was correctly blocked) that the original P0.2 wording — "create
  `gurdy/core/schema.py` skeleton" — would shadow v1's
  `gurdy/core/schema/` subpackage on this branch, forcing a
  destructive wipe of v1 code that my own iter-2 progress note
  forbade. Reframed P0 in `PLAN.md` as an *audit-first* phase: v2
  builds alongside v1 on this branch (per `V2_BOOTSTRAP.md` §12);
  P0.2–P0.5 produce a `V2_AUDIT.md` mapping each §3 contract to
  "v1 conforms" or to a sub-increment. P0.6 is the green-baseline
  acceptance: v1's existing tests pass unchanged.
  Also added a clarifying note to `V2_BOOTSTRAP.md` §6 that the
  scaffold layout is **logical**, not a literal "wipe and replace".
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0.2 — the v1-core audit.
  Read `gurdy/core/schema/`, `gurdy/core/spec/`,
  `gurdy/core/pair.py`, `gurdy/core/interp/` on this branch. Map
  the public symbols to `V2_BOOTSTRAP.md` §3 pillars. Create
  `V2_AUDIT.md` with one row per contract. Read-only; commit only
  the audit doc.
- **Open blockers**: none. (The course-correction was caught by
  the automated classifier — exactly the right behaviour. Worth
  noting in case a future iteration is tempted to expand scope.)

## 2026-05-16T00:50:00Z — P0.1 pyproject.toml

- **Phase**: P0 (P0.1 done).
- **What changed**: `pyproject.toml` version bumped to `0.2.0.dev0`
  to mark v2-track development; added `solvers-pono` extra
  (subprocess binary; no Python pkg dep) and `solvers-all`
  convenience extra (z3 + bitwuzla + cvc5). All other fields
  identical to `main`'s.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0.2 — `gurdy/core/{schema,
  spec,pair}.py` skeletons. Inspect `git show main:gurdy/core/
  schema.py` etc. and copy the public-surface protocol/dataclass
  shapes verbatim where they conform to V2_BOOTSTRAP.md §3/§6.
  Strip any v1.1.0-specific concretions (BranchPin, CycleInvariant
  dual_role, volatile layer) — those belong to schema versions
  later than the v1.0.0 target. Skeletons only; no implementation.
- **Open blockers**: none.

## 2026-05-16T00:30:00Z — P0 plan landed

- **Phase**: pre-P0 → P0 (planned, not yet implemented).
- **What changed**: `PLAN.md` rewritten as the v2 phase plan. v1
  PLAN.md is preserved on `main`. Phases P0–P16+ defined with
  per-phase Goal / Increments / Acceptance / References. RAM-safety
  and `no-main-edits` listed as cross-cutting concerns.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0.1 — update `pyproject.toml`
  for the v2 package layout (declare optional extras for solvers;
  keep `gurdy` script entry point). Inspect `main:pyproject.toml`
  first via `git show main:pyproject.toml`. Do not delete or rename
  any existing v1 files yet — v2 scaffold lives alongside until P0
  is fully green.
- **Open blockers**: none.

## 2026-05-16T00:00:00Z — Bootstrap created

- **Phase**: pre-P0 (scaffold not yet written).
- **What changed**: branch `v2-bootstrap` created from `main` at
  commit `59afce8`. `V2_BOOTSTRAP.md`, `V2_AGENT_LOOP.md`, and this
  file added. No code changes yet.
- **Next iteration's planned work**: P0 increment 1 — write the v2
  `PLAN.md` (phase-by-phase, in the spirit of `main`'s `PLAN.md` but
  reorganized around the three pillars per `V2_BOOTSTRAP.md` §3).
  Do not start coding until `PLAN.md` is in.
- **Open blockers**: none.
