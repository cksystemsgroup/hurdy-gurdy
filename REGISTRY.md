# Registry — languages, interpreters, pairs, and paths

The live state of the platform: which languages are registered (and own the
shared interpreters/solvers/checkers), which pairs exist, the formal model
behind each source language, and which paths the pairs induce. A pair or
language is *registered* when its brief exists here and under
[`languages/`](./languages/) or [`pairs/`](./pairs/); it is *built* when an
agent has delivered it to the [`PAIRING.md`](./PAIRING.md) contract.

## Platform deliverables

Pairs inherit a shared **framework** (registry, cache, commuting-square
oracle, path runner, solver/checker plumbing, coverage harness, path-grader,
player surface) and per-language **interpreters**. Both are **standalone
deliverables, built before pairs** ([`FRAMEWORK.md`](./FRAMEWORK.md)); the
bootstrap order is `framework → interpreters → pairs`. The framework's MVP-1
core and the RISC-V and BTOR2 interpreters are now built (`gurdy/`); the rest
are pending.

| Deliverable | Brief | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| framework (minimum viable, MVP-1) | [`FRAMEWORK.md`](./FRAMEWORK.md) §6 | **partial** — MVP-1 core + path runner + coverage harness + path-grader checks built (`gurdy/`); benchmark ingestion / witness checkers / merge-trigger pending |
| RISC-V interpreter | [`languages/riscv`](./languages/riscv/README.md) | **partial** — RV64I core built (`gurdy/languages/riscv/`); M/C, ELF, sail differential pending |
| BTOR2 interpreter | [`languages/btor2`](./languages/btor2/README.md) | **partial** — parser/printer + evaluator built (`gurdy/languages/btor2/`); sdiv/srem, `.wit`, differentials pending |
| other language interpreters | [`languages/`](./languages/) | registered (not built) |

## Languages

Each language carries a formal semantics and owns the source/target
interpreter shared by every pair that touches it
([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §6). Briefs: [`languages/`](./languages/).

| Language | Brief | Formal semantics (source of truth) | Interpreter shared by |
|----------|-------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| C        | [`c`](./languages/c/README.md) | C abstract machine (ISO C) | `c-riscv` |
| RISC-V   | [`riscv`](./languages/riscv/README.md) | RISC-V ISA specification | `c-riscv`, `riscv-btor2`, `riscv-sail` |
| AArch64  | [`aarch64`](./languages/aarch64/README.md) | Arm ARM (A-profile) | `aarch64-btor2`, `aarch64-sail` |
| WebAssembly | [`wasm`](./languages/wasm/README.md) | the official Wasm formal semantics | `wasm-btor2` |
| eBPF     | [`ebpf`](./languages/ebpf/README.md) | the eBPF ISA | `ebpf-btor2` |
| EVM      | [`evm`](./languages/evm/README.md) | EVM execution semantics | `evm-btor2` |
| BTOR2    | [`btor2`](./languages/btor2/README.md) | BTOR2 transition systems (bit-vectors + arrays) | `riscv-btor2`, `sail-btor2`, `aarch64-btor2`, `wasm-btor2`, `ebpf-btor2`, `evm-btor2` |
| SMT-LIB  | [`smtlib`](./languages/smtlib/README.md) | the SMT-LIB standard (`QF_ABV`/`QF_LIA`…) | `btor2-smtlib`, `crn-smtlib`, `python-smtlib` (candidate) |
| Sail     | [`sail`](./languages/sail/README.md) | Sail semantics (RISC-V & Arm models) | `riscv-sail`, `sail-btor2`, `aarch64-sail` |
| CRN      | [`crn`](./languages/crn/README.md) | Petri-net / CTMC mass-action semantics | `crn-smtlib` |
| SMILES   | [`smiles`](./languages/smiles/README.md) | OpenSMILES molecular-graph semantics | `smiles-formula` |
| molecular formula | [`molecular-formula`](./languages/molecular-formula/README.md) | atom multiset (Hill notation) | `smiles-formula` |
| Python (subset) | [`python`](./languages/python/README.md) | small-step subset semantics | `python-smtlib` (candidate) |

The "shared by" column is the sharing graph of
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §6 made concrete: the RISC-V
interpreter is written once and used by three pairs; the BTOR2 interpreter
once and used by six.

## Formal models per source language

Which source languages have a **Sail** model (so a Sail-mediated
fidelity-raising branch like `riscv-sail` → `sail-btor2` is possible), and
the recommended model for those that do not ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
§7, [`PATHS.md`](./PATHS.md) §4):

| Source | Sail model? | Recommended formal model / oracle | Branch implication |
|--------|-------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| RISC-V  | ✅ official `sail-riscv` (RISC-V Foundation) | the Sail RISC-V model | **built**: `riscv-sail` → `sail-btor2` |
| AArch64 | ✅ `sail-arm` (auto-translated from Arm's ASL); `sail-morello` | the Sail ARM model | **registered**: `aarch64-sail` → `sail-btor2` |
| WebAssembly | ❌ (not an ISA) | official Wasm formal semantics; **WasmCert-Isabelle/Coq**; **KWasm** | route via WasmCert/KWasm as a second path / source oracle |
| eBPF | ❌ | **CertrBPF / CertFC** (Coq); **Jitterbug** (Rosette) | CertrBPF as source oracle; optional model route |
| EVM | ❌ | **KEVM** (K); **eth-isabelle** (Lem); **EVM-Dafny** | KEVM as source oracle; optional model route |
| CRN | ❌ (not an ISA) | Petri-net / CTMC semantics; **PRISM/STORM**, **Maude** | the semantics *is* the model; PRISM/Maude as oracle |
| SMILES | ❌ | **OpenSMILES** graph semantics; **RDKit** / **InChI** | RDKit/InChI as oracle |
| Python | ❌ | **K-Python** (Guth, K framework, tested vs CPython) | K-Python (subset) as oracle |

Sail models exist for further ISAs not yet sourced here — **MIPS** /
CHERI-MIPS, **CHERI-RISC-V** / CHERIoT, **x86** (translated from the ACL2
`x86isa` model), and fragments of **IBM Power** — available if any becomes a
source. Per-language detail and citations are in each
[`languages/`](./languages/) brief.

## Reasoning targets — solvers and witness checkers

BTOR2 and SMT-LIB are reasoning languages: each owns, in addition to an
interpreter, a shared **solver** inventory (the oracle that decides) and a
shared **witness-checker** inventory (the independent re-validator). See
[`SOLVERS.md`](./SOLVERS.md); details in the language briefs.

| Reasoning language | Solvers (decide) | Witness checkers (verify) |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| BTOR2   | BtorMC, Pono, AVR | interpreter replay (`.wit`), independent-engine invariant / k-induction re-discharge, `certifaiger`-style certificate check |
| SMT-LIB | Bitwuzla, Z3, cvc5, Yices2 | model evaluation, Carcara (Alethe), LFSC, `cake_lpr` (verified LRAT) |

Both inventories are shared by every pair targeting the language; a pair
wires none of its own.

## Pairs

Briefs: [`pairs/`](./pairs/). Fidelity targets are goals to be backed by
evidence when the pair is built ([`PAIRING.md`](./PAIRING.md) §4), not yet
claims.

| Pair | Source → Target | Translator | Fidelity target | Status |
|------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|--------|
| [`c-riscv`](./pairs/c-riscv/README.md)         | C → RISC-V      | a **pinned** C compiler | `reproducible` (re-established) | registered |
| [`riscv-btor2`](./pairs/riscv-btor2/README.md) | RISC-V → BTOR2  | from the RISC-V spec | `checked` → `proved` | **partial** (RV64I integer) |
| [`aarch64-btor2`](./pairs/aarch64-btor2/README.md) | AArch64 → BTOR2 | from the Arm spec | `checked` → `proved` | registered |
| [`wasm-btor2`](./pairs/wasm-btor2/README.md)   | WebAssembly → BTOR2 | from the Wasm spec | `checked` | registered |
| [`ebpf-btor2`](./pairs/ebpf-btor2/README.md)   | eBPF → BTOR2    | from the eBPF spec | `checked` | registered |
| [`evm-btor2`](./pairs/evm-btor2/README.md)     | EVM → BTOR2     | from the EVM spec (bv256) | `checked` | registered |
| [`btor2-smtlib`](./pairs/btor2-smtlib/README.md)| BTOR2 → SMT-LIB | rule-for-rule mapping | `predicted` / `proved` | **partial** (unroll + z3 decide) |
| [`crn-smtlib`](./pairs/crn-smtlib/README.md)   | CRN → SMT-LIB   | schema-determined unrolling | `predicted` | registered |
| [`riscv-sail`](./pairs/riscv-sail/README.md)   | RISC-V → Sail   | from the RISC-V Sail model | `checked` | registered |
| [`sail-btor2`](./pairs/sail-btor2/README.md)   | Sail → BTOR2    | Sail → transition system | `checked` → `proved` | registered |
| [`aarch64-sail`](./pairs/aarch64-sail/README.md) | AArch64 → Sail | from the Arm Sail model | `checked` | registered |
| [`smiles-formula`](./pairs/smiles-formula/README.md) | SMILES → molecular formula | schema-determined (compile pair) | `predicted` | registered |
| [`python-smtlib`](./pairs/python-smtlib/README.md) | Python → SMT-LIB | schema-determined | open | **candidate** |

## Coverage and status

A pair's status reflects **measured coverage**, not a self-declaration
([`BENCHMARKS.md`](./BENCHMARKS.md)): `registered` → `partial (<coverage>)` →
`built`. `built` requires meeting the brief's coverage target (construct
inventory + public suite) with every unsupported construct hard-aborting.
Path status — branch-agreement and composed coverage per route — is computed
by the merge-triggered **path-grader agent** ([`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) §7)
and recorded against the routes below.

## Paths

The pairs form two reasoning **hubs** and a bridge between them
([`PATHS.md`](./PATHS.md)):

```text
   C ─c-riscv─▶ RISC-V ─┬─riscv-btor2──────────────▶ BTOR2 ─btor2-smtlib─▶ SMT-LIB
                        └─riscv-sail─▶ SAIL ─sail-btor2─▶ ▲                  ▲
                                                          │                  │
        AArch64 ─aarch64-btor2─▶ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┤        CRN ─crn-smtlib─┘
        WebAssembly ─wasm-btor2─▶ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─┤
        eBPF ─ebpf-btor2─▶ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┤
        EVM ─evm-btor2─▶ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘
```

- **The BTOR2 hub.** Six front-ends (RISC-V, Sail, AArch64, Wasm, eBPF, EVM)
  reach BTOR2; `btor2-smtlib` bridges BTOR2 to the SMT-LIB hub.
- **The SMT-LIB hub.** Reached via the BTOR2 bridge and directly from CRN
  (and, as a candidate, Python).
- **Two branches.** RISC-V reaches BTOR2 two ways — directly (`riscv-btor2`)
  and via Sail (`riscv-sail` → `sail-btor2`); AArch64 likewise — directly
  (`aarch64-btor2`) and via the Arm Sail model (`aarch64-sail` →
  `sail-btor2`). Each branch is cross-checked to raise fidelity
  ([`PATHS.md`](./PATHS.md) §4–5).
- **Solve-step corroboration.** Every BTOR2-targeting front-end can be
  decided native-vs-bridged through `btor2-smtlib`
  ([`SOLVERS.md`](./SOLVERS.md) §7).

## Adding to the registry

A human registers a new **language** by adding `languages/<name>/README.md`
(formal semantics + interpreter contract; for reasoning targets, the solver
and checker inventories) and a new **pair** by adding
`pairs/<source>-<target>/README.md` (the brief, per [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)
§1), then triggering its per-pair agent. Update the tables above in the same
change.
